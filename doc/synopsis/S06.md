Class
======

## Simple class declaration

To define a PHP class with constructor:

    <?
    class Snake
        new: ->

    s = new Snake

which will be transformed into:

    <?
    class Snake {
        function __construct() {

        }
    }


## Members


### General member

To define general class members, use `has`, which will be public class members:

    class Snake
        has name
        has length

which will be transformed into:

    <?
    class Snake {
        public $name;
        public $length;
    }

### Private member

To define private class members:

    class Person
        has private phone
        has private address

### Protected member

    class Person
        has protected phone
        has protected address

## Inheritance

To inherit a parent class, you can simply use a `:` character to inherit the
parent class.

To define a PHP class with inheritance:

    <?
    class Snake is Animal
        new: ->



## Interface

To implement an interface for a class:

    <?
    class Headlignt is Light 
        does LightInterface

which will be transformed to:

    <?
    class Headlight extends Light 
        implements LightInterface
    {

    }

## Traits

Traits is only available after PHP5.4.
